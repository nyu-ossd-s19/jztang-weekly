## Making a Browser Extension & GitHub/Git Workflow

### Laying the groundwork

This is my first time working on code in a group, so I had to familiarize myself with the proper GitHub/git workflow (detailed below). Our group's browser extension is called [Memeify](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/memeify-team-1), and its function is to replace "normal" things on websites with memes. I started off by creating the project repository and creating the basic starting files for an open source browser extension. After that, I submitted a few feature ideas as issues on the GitHub page. I worked on two of these issues this week.

The [first issue](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/memeify-team-1/issues/6) I worked on was creating a popup user interface for the extension. It would allow users to toggle on/off each feature of the extension individually. While the HTML/CSS for the UI is basically done, I have yet to make it functional with Javascript. I hope to finish making the popup UI functional within the next week.

The [second issue](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/memeify-team-1/issues/5) I worked on was replacing any instance of the letter "B" on a webpage with the emoji ðŸ…±. Another group member, Alisha, had already implemented code that searched all text nodes on the page, so I just added on to that. The trouble I had with implementing this was dealing with how Javascript deals with emoji. While emoji are typically represented as a code point, its encoding is greater than 16-bit. Javascript strings are a sequence of 16-bit code points, so it cannot parse a standard emoji code point. This requires translating the single code point (greater than 16-bit) into a "surrogate pair" of code points, each 16-bit. Javascript is able to parse this surrogate pair as an emoji. This information and translation regarding Javascript emoji is thanks to [Kevin Scott](https://thekevinscott.com/emojis-in-javascript/). You can see this feature in work below.

### Progress report

Because of the design of the extension, features are largely independent of each other. This means that it was technically functional when the first feature added. The extension currently has three features:

- Replace images on the page with a random meme image
- Replace all instances of the word "the" with "MEME"
- Replace all instances of the letter "B" with ðŸ…±

We have many more features planned, so we plan on working on these new features, as well as refining existing ones if necessary.

### Things I learned about GitHub/git

Prior to this project, I only used git on an individual basis. Starting the browser extension assignment, I learned many more functions of git that are used when it comes to working with a team. These include:

- Creating issues
- Forking a shared repository to work on it seperately
- Creating a feature branch
- Opening a pull request
- Resolving merge conflicts
- The general workflow between a feature branch, master, origin, and upstream
