blog about your own experience with creating the browser extension, comment on collaborative aspect of it, how easy was it to work with your team members, were you collaborating remotely, did you meet to work on the code together, how were the decisions made about the design of the project, how were you communicating

## Collaborating on a Project

Making [Memeify](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/memeify-team-1), a browser extension, was my first time collaborating on code with other people. I realized that working collaboratively on code would be a nightmare if there wasn't a version control system like Git/GitHub. We did not meet up to work on the code together, so that meant working separately and at different times.

One person suggested the idea for Memeify, and shortly after the rest of us decided to go with it. Our main platform for communication was a Facebook group chat, where we discussed ideas for the design of the extension. Officially, ideas for features were added as issues on the extension repository, and members claimed the ones they were working on.
