## Open Source Mental Health

This week, I looked at [if me](https://www.if-me.org/), an open source app that provides a platform for sharing stories related to mental health. I chose this project because mental health awareness is very important to me. I've dealt with my share of mental health issues, and now I know how important awareness is.

By sharing our stories and battles with mental health, we help to break the stigma regarding mental health, and encourage others to share their experiences. The more we share and open up about it, the less power mental illness has over us, and sharing can let others know that they are not alone.

Below, I evaluate if me's potential as an open source project that someone just starting out could join.
