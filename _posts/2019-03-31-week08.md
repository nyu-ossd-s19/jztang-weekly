## Starting to Contribute

My group for contributing to open source chose to work on React. This week, our group all tried to find issues in the React repository that we could start off with as we get involved in React. After looking through the existing issues, we realized that it was difficult to find a beginner-friendly issue. Additionally, working on the React source code itself is not quite the same as working in React, which is what we all actually wanted to do.

So instead, we are thinking about switching our project to one that actually utilizes React in the way we wanted (like React components). I found a few projects that might fit the bill, such as: [Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui), [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper), [React Virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized), and [React Beautiful DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). In addition to this, I am also going through some tutorials so that I can learn the basics of React, since I do not have prior experience with it. Next week, we will have decided on a project that uses React, and go on from there.

## Wikipedia
