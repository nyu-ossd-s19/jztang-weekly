## Humanitarian Open Source

With the rise of globalization and technology, it makes sense that software is becoming more and more utilized for humanitarian causes. Humanitarian organizations are mostly non-profits, getting their resources from donations and grants. Open source fills the need for software that helps organize and manage humanitarian efforts at a large scale. Because the work that humanitarian open source projects do is so critical, I think that it's harder to get involved with than regular open source. Problems with the software could mean the difference between life and death, so extreme care must be taken when working with a humanitarian open source projects. Since I am a beginner to open source, I probably would not want to get involved in humanitarian open source just yet.

Below, I evaluate HospitalRun, a humanitarian open source project.
