## Team Project Updates

This week, I worked on the issue I found last week regarding sliders. The solution wasn't as simple as I thought. I thought that I could just set the focus on the slider in the click handler, but that didn't solve it. A maintainer did reply to my [pull request](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/pull/15439), although their comment didn't provide too much insight. It took a while for me to understand what the code did, but I finally figured out what the issue was. One of the event handlers, `handleMouseDown`, uses `event.preventDefault()`, which prevented the focus from being set on the slider. I commented this on my PR, and asked if this change would break anything else. If it doesn't, I can probably get my PR merged this week.

As for the group, half of the members were out this week, so we couldn't get much done. We'll be one of the last groups to present, so we need to use this time to finally work on something together as a group.
